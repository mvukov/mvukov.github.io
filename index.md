# Education

## PhD in Control Engineering

2010 - 2015, [KU Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.be/), Belgium

I have been lucky to do an applied PhD, which later enabled me to make a somehow smooth transition from academia to industry. A big chunk of my time I spent developing software for fast MPC & MHE based on automatic code generation. Enhanced implementations yielded up to order of magnitude speedups compared to existing ones. Next to developing the software, I was heavily involved in the experimental validations of MPC & MHE on a couple of challenging real-world applications.

* **Thesis:** "Embedded Model Predictive Control and Moving Horizon Estimation for Mechatronics Applications" [PDF](ftp://ftp.esat.kuleuven.be/pub/SISTA/mvukov/reports/thesis_final_print.pdf)
* **Supervisor:** Professor [Moritz Diehl](http://www.syscop.de)

## MSc in Control Engineering

2002 - 2008, [Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en), Serbia

In the beginning, I had an idea to study computer science and AI. By the time we have had to choose a more focused direction, I figured out the AI curriculum was shady and CS was too dry. Eventually, I chose control engineering and later focused on control of electrical drives and robotics.

Following a five year program, I have graduated at the Signals and Systems Department.

* **Diploma thesis:** "Design of software solutions based on USB interface for real-time measurement and control applications"
* **Supervisor:** Professor [Slobodan N. VukosaviÄ‡](http://vukosavic.etf.bg.ac.rs)

## Secondary education

1998 - 2002, [Mathematical Grammar School](http://www.mg.edu.rs/en), Serbia

At some point, I became fascinated by neural networks and their prediction capabilities. Eventually, I chose for my final project to make an overview of neural nets both from mathematical and biological perspectives.
